#### ABSTRACT:

While macroinvertebrate dispersal operates at the individual level, predictions of their dispersal capabilities often rely on indirect proxies rather than direct measurements.
 To gain insight into the dispersal of individual specimens, it is crucial to mark (label) and capture individuals. Isotopic enrichment with 15N is a non-invasive method with 
the potential of labelling large quantities of macroinvertebrates. While the analysis of 15N is widely utilised in food web studies, knowledge on the specific utility of 
isotopic enrichment with 15N for mass labelling of macroinvertebrate individuals across different taxa and feeding types is limited. Previous studies have focused on single 
species and feeding types, leaving gaps in our understanding of the broader applicability of this method. Therefore, this study aimed to test and compare isotopic mass 
enrichment across several macroinvertebrate taxa and feeding types. We released 15NH4Cl at five stream reaches in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, and successfully enriched 12
 distinct macroinvertebrate taxa (Crustacea and Insecta). Significant enrichment was achieved in active and passive filter feeders, grazers, shredders, and predators, and 
predominantly showed positive correlations with the enrichment of the taxa’s main food sources phytobenthos and particulate organic matter. Enrichment levels rose rapidly 
and peaked at distances between 50 m and 300 m downstream of the isotopic inlet; significant enrichment occurred up to 2,000 m downstream of the isotopic inlet in all feeding 
types. Macroinvertebrate density estimates on the stream bottom averaged to a total of approximately 3.4 million labelled individuals of the 12 investigated taxa, thus showing 
the high potential of isotopic (15N) enrichment as a non-invasive method applicable for mass labelling across different macroinvertebrate feeding types. Hence, isotopic enrichment 
can greatly assist the analysis of macroinvertebrate dispersal through mark-and-recapture experiments, as it allows to measure the movement at the level of individual specimens.
